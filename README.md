#Ping Pong Game

##Introduction 
- This is a very simple, friendly ping-pong game project, developed after I had almost
completed module Object-Oriented Programming in the second semester at university.

##Features
- 2-player game
- Basic GUI using JAVA's libraries including AWT and Swing.
- Simple operation with ball movement and collision detection.
- Writed by 100% Java and Object-Oriented structure : separate class for Ball,
Player, Render, GameManager and ControlWindow.

##How to run
1. Clone from my github link
2. Install Java SE
3. Compile the source files in your terminal, including 2 steps :
+ javac PingPong.java
+ java PingPong.java


Note: This version is basic prototype. I am planning to redesign the game with vivid visuals, and a more engaging experience. Furthermore, I also aim to provide packaged .exe version so you can try it without compiling the source files.
